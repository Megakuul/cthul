- move domain operator to reqnode pattern (always one core field which must be done before the others) x
- refactor to slog instead of internal logger x
- update controllers with reqnode (domain, video) x
- refactor controllers to use core property as anchor x
- fix the detach logic (-> device is just never detached by the libvirt adapter) x
- implement other devices (video x serial x disk x interface x)
- refactor wave domain controller + operator to only use serialized config (proto)
- refactor libvirtctrlr to use serialized config instead of the struct defined
- refactor the scheduler to do the same
- define grpc api granit, proton, + wave components that are not domain
- do the last 3 steps for proton and granit
- create startup code + perform initial wave tests
- Move the NodeMismatchErr anywhere more useful (in a util or something, just that its not seperate for every controller)
- Implement granit + proton operators (disk / interface)
- Check if granit must store device FORMAT on database (should that not be rather important in the config and not to the underlying granit)
