- Implement sisyphos
- Move the NodeMismatchErr anywhere more useful (in a util or something, just that its not seperate for every controller)
- Implement granit + proton operators (disk / interface)
- Check if granit must store device FORMAT on database (should that not be rather important in the config and not to the underlying granit)
- implement flow (collect systemd-journal-gatewayd + metrics)

- does it make sense to define the protocol type on the domain config instead of the device config (videoDevice)?
